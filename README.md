# Simple Weather App

A simple weather forecast website written in Vue.js.

The live version of this app is hosted at https://vue-example-weather.netlify.app/. It may take a few seconds to wake up.

The weather data is sourced from OpenWeather, and Google's geocoding API is used to lookup the client's location. These API calls are made from a custom backend which has its own repo at https://github.com/lkelsall/weather-be.

The weather icons are from https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/
